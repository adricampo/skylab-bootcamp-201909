# Time2Padel

## Description

Time2Padel is an individual project that I have developed for SkylabCoders bootcamp, as the endpoint of all the course we did. 

It has been designed as a mobile first Application that provides information about the leagues you can find in a padel club. 
You must be registered to see the content of the page, once you do that you can find many information and the list of leagues the club has available on that moment, filtered by level, gender and timming. 

Users information will be stored in a data base where we will later call them to recover the information required to join the different leagues.
